### 1. Why does Thrashing Occur?
Thrashing occurs when a computer’s virtual memory system is overused, leading to constant paging and swapping of data between RAM and disk. This can drastically reduce system performance because the CPU spends more time swapping pages than executing instructions. It typically happens when the system has insufficient physical memory to handle the demands of running processes, causing frequent page faults and excessive paging.

### 2. What is Paging and Why Do We Need It?
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. It divides the process’s memory into fixed-size pages and maps them to physical memory frames. Paging helps in:
- Efficient utilization of memory by allowing non-contiguous memory allocation.
- Isolation and protection of processes by providing each process its own virtual address space.
- Simplification of memory management by reducing fragmentation.

### 3. Demand Paging and Segmentation
- **Demand Paging:** A type of paging where pages are loaded into memory only when they are needed, reducing memory usage and improving performance. It uses a page table to keep track of pages in memory and those on disk.
- **Segmentation:** A memory management scheme that divides the process memory into variable-sized segments based on logical divisions such as functions, data, etc. Segments are managed through a segment table and provide a way to handle large data structures efficiently.

### 4. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) and Types
An RTOS is designed to handle real-time applications that require immediate processing of data without delays. The primary goal is to ensure that critical tasks are completed within a specific time frame.

**Types of RTOS:**
- **Hard RTOS:** Guarantees that critical tasks are completed on time. Used in applications where timing is critical (e.g., medical systems, industrial control systems).
- **Soft RTOS:** Ensures that critical tasks receive priority over less critical tasks but does not guarantee strict timing. Used in multimedia systems, telecommunications.
- **Firm RTOS:** A mix of hard and soft RTOS where deadlines are important, but occasional deadline misses are acceptable without catastrophic consequences.

### 5. Difference between Main Memory and Secondary Memory
- **Main Memory (RAM):** Volatile memory used for storing data that is actively being used or processed by the CPU. It provides fast access and is directly accessible by the CPU.
- **Secondary Memory (Storage):** Non-volatile memory used for long-term storage of data. It includes devices like hard drives, SSDs, and CDs. It is slower than main memory but provides persistent storage.

### 6. Dynamic Binding
Dynamic binding refers to the process where the method to be executed in response to a function call is determined at runtime. It is used in object-oriented programming to achieve polymorphism, allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.

### 7. FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) Scheduling
FCFS is a simple scheduling algorithm where the process that arrives first is executed first. It is non-preemptive, meaning that once a process starts executing, it runs to completion. It can lead to the "convoy effect," where short processes wait for long processes.

### 8. SJF (Shortest Job First) Scheduling
SJF is a scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the shortest execution time next. It can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It minimizes average waiting time but requires precise knowledge of the execution time of each process.

### 9. SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First) Scheduling
SRTF is a preemptive version of SJF. The process with the shortest remaining execution time is selected next. If a new process arrives with a shorter remaining time, it preempts the current process. It aims to reduce the average waiting time.

### 10. LRTF (Longest Remaining Time First) Scheduling
LRTF is a scheduling algorithm where the process with the longest remaining execution time is selected next. It is less common and generally not used in practice due to its inefficiency and potential to increase waiting time.

### 11. Priority Scheduling
In Priority Scheduling, each process is assigned a priority, and the process with the highest priority is executed first. It can be preemptive or non-preemptive. A potential issue is starvation, where low-priority processes may never execute.

### 12. Round Robin Scheduling
Round Robin Scheduling allocates a fixed time quantum to each process in the ready queue in a cyclic order. It is preemptive and ensures fairness by giving each process an equal share of the CPU. It is widely used in time-sharing systems.

### 13. Producer-Consumer Problem
The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic synchronization problem where producers generate data and place it in a buffer, and consumers take data from the buffer. It requires synchronization to ensure the buffer does not overflow or underflow.

### 14. Banker’s Algorithm
The Banker’s Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems to allocate resources safely. It checks if granting a resource request will leave the system in a safe state, where all processes can eventually obtain their required resources.

### 15. Explain Cache
Cache is a small, fast memory located close to the CPU, used to store frequently accessed data and instructions. It helps reduce the average time to access memory by keeping frequently used data closer to the CPU.

### 16. Difference between Direct Mapping and Associative Mapping
- **Direct Mapping:** Each block of main memory maps to exactly one cache line. Simple and fast but can lead to collisions.
- **Associative Mapping:** Any block of main memory can be placed in any cache line. More flexible and reduces collisions but requires complex hardware.

### 17. Difference between Multitasking and Multiprocessing
- **Multitasking:** Running multiple tasks (processes) on a single CPU by switching between them, giving the illusion of parallelism.
- **Multiprocessing:** Using multiple CPUs to execute multiple processes simultaneously, providing true parallelism.
