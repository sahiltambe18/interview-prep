### 1. Phishing

**Phishing** involves tricking individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications, often via email or fake websites.

### 2. Malware

**Malware** (malicious software) includes various types of harmful software, such as:
- **Viruses:** Self-replicating programs that attach to legitimate files.
- **Worms:** Standalone malware that replicates itself to spread to other computers.
- **Trojans:** Disguised as legitimate software but perform malicious activities once executed.
- **Ransomware:** Encrypts files on the victim's system and demands a ransom to restore access.

### 3. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack

In a **MitM attack**, the attacker intercepts communication between two parties to steal or alter the data being transmitted. This can happen over unsecured networks, like public Wi-Fi.

### 4. Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks

**DoS** attacks overwhelm a system or network with traffic, rendering it unavailable to users. **DDoS** attacks are similar but originate from multiple compromised systems, making them more difficult to mitigate.

### 5. SQL Injection

**SQL Injection** involves inserting malicious SQL code into a query, allowing attackers to interfere with the database queries that an application makes. This can lead to unauthorized access to data or manipulation of the database.

### 6. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**XSS** attacks inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

### 7. Password Attacks

**Password attacks** aim to obtain user passwords through various methods:
- **Brute Force:** Trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Using a list of common passwords.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Using credentials obtained from other data breaches.

### 8. Insider Threats

**Insider threats** are security risks that originate from within the organization. Employees or other trusted individuals with access to sensitive information may misuse it maliciously or accidentally.

### 9. Zero-Day Exploit

A **zero-day exploit** targets a vulnerability that is unknown to the software or hardware vendor. Because the vulnerability is not known, there is no patch or fix available at the time of the attack.

### 10. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

**APTs** involve prolonged and targeted cyber attacks where an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period. These attacks aim to steal data rather than cause damage.

### 11. Social Engineering

**Social engineering** exploits human psychology to gain access to sensitive information. Examples include pretexting, baiting, and tailgating.

### 12. Eavesdropping Attack

**Eavesdropping attacks** involve intercepting and listening to private communications over a network. Attackers capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal details.

### 13. DNS Spoofing

**DNS spoofing** (or DNS cache poisoning) involves manipulating DNS records to redirect traffic from a legitimate site to a malicious one. This can lead to phishing and data theft.

### 14. Drive-by Download

In a **drive-by download** attack, malicious code is downloaded and executed on a user's device without their knowledge or consent when they visit a compromised website.

### 15. Session Hijacking

**Session hijacking** involves taking control of a user's session after they've successfully authenticated. The attacker uses the session token to gain unauthorized access to the user's data.
